					<h3>Overview</h3>
				</header>

				<p>
					I'm currently studying at the University of Pittsburgh's Swanson School of Engineering where I will earn a Bachelors Degree of Electrical Engineering in April of 2023. My degree overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic when all classes were moved online for roughly 1.5 years. I never enjoyed online classes so I used this period as an opportunity to earn experience in the workforce and push my graduation back 1 year.<br />
					<br />During my 4 years of undergrad, I have completed rougly 20 months worth of internships in the fields of robotics, medical devices, and military equipment. At the same I was studying and working, I was contributing to Pitt SailBot, a club I co-founded in 2019 and eventually grew sucessful enough to compete in 2022 and win 3rd place at the International Robotic Sailing Regatta.
					<br /><br />I am very passionate about hardware design, unique implementations of electronics, and robotics but outside of these I love to sail. I compete for the university on the Pitt Sailing Team where we travel around the northeastern United States and race against other universities. During my time at Pitt, I led the team to our highest ever qualification round and have raced at more than 12 colleges.

					<h3>Skills</h3>

				<p>
					From coursework and internship experience, I am extemely proficient with the CAD and eCAD softwares Altium/Eagle/OrCAD, LTSpice, Fusion 360 and Virtuoso. I also have many hours of fabrication experience including high-speed circuit design, SMD component soldering by hand or by stencil, component sourcing and PCBA ordering, debugging with lab equipment, PCB prototyping using laser etching, and composite manufacturing.
					<br /><br />
					I am also familiar with C++, C, Python, firmware for ST and MSP MCUs, Eclipse based IDEs, MATLAB & Simulink, SolidWorks, Linux, Git, and Atlassian Software (Confluence, Jira, etc.).
